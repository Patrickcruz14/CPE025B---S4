<h2 id="About">About Eusebio High School</h2>
<blockquote>
Eusebio High School formerly known as Eusebio High School Rosario Annex has grown from a small high school situated at Maybunga Elementary School to a splurging annex into an independent large high school. At present Dr. Gilbert O. Inocencio leads and manages the 5, 441 leaners, 182 teaching personnel, and 33 non-teaching personnel of Eusebio High School. As situations in school are slowly returning to normal. EHS is working on its way now to continue its growth not just in number but in all aspects to better serve its learners and its entire community. Technically, the school is already 46 years in existence but as “Eusebio High School” which assumed it’s independency as a separate school since April 14, 2004, it is 19 years old as of this school year. With the dynamism of it’s new leader, the visionary Dr. Gilbert O. Inocencio and with the concerted effort of the school’s entire work force, surely Eusebio High School is on its way to the highest possible standard it can reach.
